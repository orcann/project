Tips on using Git
=================

Each time you sit down to work on a project, you should start your session
with `git pull` so that you can be sure that you're working with the 
latest version of the code. 

At the end of the session, you should make sure to commit any important
changes you've made.  However, you should only push changes that you are
sure do not break the system.
